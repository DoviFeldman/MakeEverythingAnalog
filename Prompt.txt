make me a very simple github pages website that so far just has 1 page thats just a single HTML file that i can copy paste.

i want it to be just 1 picture. i have the picture, and i want that to be the whole webpage.

there are some items in the picture that when people press over those items it 1 opens up another page or 2 opens up a link.

i want you to give me the code for the website and the invisible boxes for people to press the picture and it will open up for them,
3 of them are links and 3 of them are new pages on the website that i will build later. 

and include instructions for how to place the link and pages buttons over the objects in the picture exactly so that when people press on the specific items
that are in the picture they will be pressing on the link buttons.
